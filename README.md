# How to Install a Minecraft Mod (Step-by-Step Guide)

This guide explains how to properly install a Minecraft mod on **Windows**, including what you need to download and how to access the Minecraft files using `%appdata%`.

---

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Minecraft **Java Edition**
- A mod loader (**Forge** or **Fabric**)
- The mod file (`.jar`)
- Java installed on your system

---

## 1. Download a Mod Loader

Mods require a mod loader to work.

### Forge
https://files.minecraftforge.net/

### Fabric
https://fabricmc.net/

Important:
The mod loader version must match the mod version (for example, 1.21.4).

---

## 2. Install Forge or Fabric

1. Open the downloaded `.jar` file
2. Select **Install Client**
3. Click **OK**
4. Open **Minecraft Launcher**
5. Select the **Forge** or **Fabric** profile
6. Launch the game once, then close it

This will generate the required folders.

---

## 3. Open the Minecraft Folder

To access the Minecraft files:

1. Press **WIN + R**
2. Type: %appdata%
3. Press **Enter**
4. Open the `.minecraft` folder

Full path: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming.minecraft


---

## 4. Install the Mod

1. Inside `.minecraft`, open the `mods` folder  
   If it does not exist, create it manually.

2. Drag and drop the mod `.jar` file into the `mods` folder

Notes:
- Do not extract the mod
- Do not rename the file

---

## 5. Launch Minecraft

1. Open **Minecraft Launcher**
2. Select the **Forge** or **Fabric** profile
3. Click **Play**

If everything is correct, Minecraft will start with the mod loaded.

---

## Common Issues

### Game crashes on startup
- Mod version does not match Forge/Fabric version
- Incompatible mods
- Outdated or missing Java

### Mod does not appear in-game
- Mod is in the wrong folder
- Wrong Minecraft profile selected
